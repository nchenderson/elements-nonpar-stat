# Permutation Tests {#permutation}

## Notation

* A permutation of a set $S$ is a particular ordering of the elements of $S$.

* For example, if $S = \{1,2,3\}$, then $(3,1,2)$ is a permutation of $S$ where 
$(3, 2, 1)$ means that this is an ordered list.

* There are $5$ other permutations of $S$: $(1,2,3), (2,1,3), (1,3,2), (3,2,1), (2, 3, 1)$. 

* If $S$ has $n$ distinct elements, there are $n!$ permutations of $S$.
