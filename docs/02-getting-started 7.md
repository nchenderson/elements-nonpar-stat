# Working with R {#getting-started}

You can download R by visiting https://www.r-project.org/ and clicking on the **download R** link. Follow the instructions
to complete installation. THe most recent version is version 3.6.2.

It is not necessary to use this, but I find **RStudio** to be a very useful integrated development environment (IDE) 
for computing with **R**. **RStudio** may be downloaded and installed by visiting https://rstudio.com/

Before we can start exploring data in R, there are some key concepts to understand first:

1. How do I code in R?
1. What are R packages?

If you are already familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip to Section \@ref(nycflights13) below introducing some of the datasets we will explore in depth in this book. Much of this chapter is based on two sources which you should feel free to use as references if you are looking for additional details:
